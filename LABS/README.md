# Labs

## Counter Lab

Consider doing the counter lab first, as a warm up. Especially if you didn't get very far when we did it before.

[Counter Lab](./counter.md)

## Books Lab

This will be more intense. There are _some_ instructions, but will require you to _apply_ what you've learned about Angular.

Do not feel too constrained by the _requirements_ - use the time to learn and explore.

## Optional Bonus Labs

There are a few things that I think need cleaned up. They are here [Bonus](./bonus.md)

## Getting Setup (I will guide you through this)

Go to https://github.com/HypertheoryTraining/applied-angular-lab-jan-30-2025

Click the "fork" button.

Hit the "Create Fork" button.

This will create a fork (copy) of the lab in your Github account.

After the fork is created, click the [<> Code] button, make sure the "Github CLI" tab is selected, and copy the command that is displayed.

On your VM, open the [>_] Windows Terminal. You should be in the class folder.

Past the command you copied above into your terminal and run it.

Example:

```sh
gh repo clone YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT/applied-angular-lab-jan-30-2025
```

Type the following in the terminal:

```sh
cd applied-angular-lab-dec-19-2024-trial
npm ci && code
```

Get ready to rock.

Do the lab(s). Commit your code and push it as often as you like.

When you are _done_, push your final changes to the Github, open your repo in the browser on github, and send a pull request.

Hit the "contribute" button, make a pull request, giving me a brief note about what you did.
