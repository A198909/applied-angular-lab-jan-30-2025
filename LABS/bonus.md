## Extract a Link List Component from the Navigation Component

We have, as I showed earlier, repeated code in the navigation component for displaying links.

Please extract this to a component with an input for the list links to display.

## Consider Making the Navigation Links (other than the top navigation bar) consistent.

We have links displayed all over the app, in almost every feature. Each one is styled individually.

Consider creating a directive in `src/app/shared/directives` that will consistently style all the links on our site.
